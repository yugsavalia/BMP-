sa_sortie.py -- SA sortie planner for the dynamic simulator.

PORTED, NOT IMPORTED, from sa_repair2.py. Reasons:
  - sa_repair2 / compare_baseline solve a K-WAY SIMULTANEOUS PARTITION over a
    fixed node set with fixed tcd (data volume). A dynamic sortie is ONE drone,
    ONE route, chosen at launch time from live ages/weights with an ESTIMATED
    dwell -- the K=1 special case of the same combinatorial problem, but a
    different objective and different inputs.
  - compare_baseline's module-level constants (AREA=1000, Emax=50000, Pf=150,
    Ph=200) are the OLD static scale. This uses DynParams throughout.
  - The valuable, tested part of sa_repair2 is the k-for-1 COST-AWARE REPAIR
    OPERATOR (CONTEXT_16): pick the insertion target first, eject the
    cheapest-value-per-joule served nodes until it fits. That is what unfroze
    SA at cap-packed cells, and dynamic sorties are cap-packed by construction
    (CONTEXT_65 measured 92-96% energy utilisation under the stub). Ported here
    verbatim in spirit, adapted to a single chain.

OBJECTIVE -- a documented simplification, not a full port of fleet_obj.
  fleet_obj's chain_waoi accumulates CUMULATIVE weighted delay: a node visited
  late in a chain is charged for the priority-weight of every node visited
  before it, because those earlier stops delayed it. That structure is correct
  for a single static mission with fixed payloads.

  Here we instead maximise
        value(route) = sum_j  weight_est[j] * age[j]
  i.e. total priority-weighted age reset, independent of visit order within the
  sortie. Order is chosen by the move set to fit as much value as possible in
  the energy budget, but is NOT charged for intra-sortie delay.

  This is deliberately simpler than porting the full cumulative-delay objective,
  because within one ~15-min sortie the ordering effect on AGE AT COLLECTION is
  second-order next to the SET of nodes chosen -- but it is a simplification,
  not a proof, and should be revisited if C4 numbers look sensitive to it.

SEEDING -- CONTEXT_60 §5.4 / this session's finding.
  sa_repair2.py's own main() seeds BOTH the baseline and repair arms by RESTART
  INDEX (0 or 1), not by instance. That bug is confirmed present in the file as
  uploaded, unfixed. It is NOT ported here: every call below takes an explicit,
  distinct seed built from (sortie index, restart index), never a bare small
  integer reused across restarts.
