"""relcost_drift.py -- Prop. 4 relative-cost profile invariance (§V-B).

usage: python relcost_drift.py ["nodes_paper_M100_*_K*_s*_exclude_launch.npz"]

What this measures, and why the obvious version does not work
-------------------------------------------------------------
c_i = 2 P_f r_i / v depends on r_i only, and SensorField is built from (seed, M, layout) -- never
from K. So within a seed the radius vector is BYTE-IDENTICAL across K. Any comparison that masks
two K's radius vectors to a common support and normalises each by the mean OVER THAT SUPPORT is
comparing a vector to itself, and returns exactly 0.0 no matter what the data does.

The quantity that actually varies with K is the served SET: raising K shrinks E_u = U/K, so fewer
and nearer sensors get visited. That moves the normalising constant c-bar(K) = mean of c over the
nodes served at K. So for nodes served at BOTH K and K0, this script compares

    a_i = c_i / c-bar(K)        against        b_i = c_i / c-bar(K0)

and reports mean |a_i - b_i|. Pairs are matched by seed, then averaged across seeds.

Interpretation: the profile SHAPE is K-invariant by construction; what drifts is the scale, driven
entirely by which sensors get served. Report the number as evidence about set composition, not as an
independent confirmation of Prop. 4's invariance assumption.
